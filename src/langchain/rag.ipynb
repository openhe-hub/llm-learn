       " 'answer': 'ECE4010J is a foundational course on probability and statistics designed for students with no prior knowledge in these subjects. It aims to equip students with technical skills such as applying Bayes’s theorem, calculating Pearson correlation coefficients, and transforming random variables. Additionally, the course develops soft skills like critical thinking, understanding the non-intuitive nature of probability, and the ability to interpret statistical outputs correctly, with an emphasis on moral and social responsibility.'}"
